# 🔍 Circle Detection using OpenCV (Hough Circle Transform)

This repository demonstrates how to detect circular objects in an image using **OpenCV’s Hough Circle Transform** in Python.  
It is useful for computer vision tasks such as **iris detection, shape analysis, and object measurement**.

---

## 📌 What This Project Does
- Loads an image using OpenCV
- Converts the image to **grayscale** (required for Hough Circle detection)
- Detects circles using the **Hough Gradient method**
- Filters detections based on **minimum and maximum radius**
- Draws detected circles and their center points
- Displays the final output using **Matplotlib**

## 🧠 Applications
- Iris and eye detection  
- Medical image analysis  
- Shape-based object detection  
- Computer vision learning projects
